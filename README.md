# Discord Rich Presence for Space Station 13

A very simple project I've started, but somehow took me several days to complete.
You can download the source code here at the top of the page, or download the release builds on the right.

If you encounter an error, feel free to make either a pull request or an issue (I don't check github often).

## Compiling
I made this in codeblocks with the following parameters, but I'm unsure on how it would build on other programs:
`-Wall -s -O3 -static -Og -Wall -Wunreachable-code -mwindows -lShlwapi -lpsapi -lpthread `

## Other Rich Presence Applications
I wanted to make my own version of the other already-available applications that have done better than I probably could
If you would like to use those instead of them, feel free to check them out:
