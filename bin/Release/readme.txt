Once the application opens, you can find it in the taskbar tray (in the corner that looks like ^), however there is no icon currently for it, so it will just be an invisible square.
The application will stay open and watch for any Space Station 13 windows and update your discord status accordingly, assuming you're already logged into discord.

To exit the program, you can right click the taskbar icon and select "Exit"
